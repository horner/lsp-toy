# Logging Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

Reduced verbose logging while keeping important diagnostic information.

### Files Modified

1. **server/src/capabilities/hover.ts**
2. **server/src/capabilities/completion.ts**
3. **server/src/embedded/embeddedManager.ts**
4. **server/src/utils/document.ts**

## What Was Removed

### Hover Capability ‚ùå
- ~~`onHover called for: <uri>`~~
- ~~`Position: line X, char Y`~~
- ~~`Document not found`~~
- ~~`Fence check: found=yes/no`~~
- ~~`Position inside embedded fence`~~
- ~~`Returning embedded hover result`~~
- ~~`Embedded hover unavailable, showing helpful hint`~~
- ~~`Falling back to host`~~
- ~~`Parse tree not available`~~
- ~~`No hover info available at this position`~~
- ~~`Returning hover info: <preview>`~~

### Completion Capability ‚ùå
- ~~`onCompletion called for: <uri>`~~
- ~~`Position: line X, char Y`~~
- ~~`Trigger character: 'X' or none`~~
- ~~`Position inside embedded fence`~~
- ~~`Returning N embedded completion items`~~
- ~~`Embedded completion unavailable, falling back to host`~~
- ~~`Providing section header completions`~~
- ~~`Providing link and markdown format completions`~~
- ~~`Providing all default completions (no trigger)`~~
- ~~`Returning N completion items`~~

### Document Parsing ‚ùå
- ~~`Parsing document, length: X chars`~~
- ~~`Parse successful, cached tree for <uri>`~~
- ~~`Using cached parse tree`~~
- ~~`No cached tree, parsing now...`~~
- ~~`Parse failed!`~~

### Fence Management ‚ùå
- ~~`extracted N fence(s) from <full uri>`~~
- ~~`detected fence lang=X lines=Y-Z (fence at line N)`~~ (for supported languages)
- ~~`invalidated N fence(s) for <uri>`~~
- ~~`findFenceAt: docUri=<uri>, position=X:Y, cached fences=N`~~
- ~~`Fence ranges: [0] lang: lines X-Y ...`~~ (full fence list)
- ~~`Found fence: lang=X, lines=Y-Z`~~
- ~~`No fence contains position X`~~

## What Was Kept ‚úÖ

### Critical Information
- ‚úÖ `[EMBED] Cached N fence(s)` - Shows fence extraction succeeded
- ‚úÖ `[EMBED] ruby fence (unsupported) at line X` - Alerts about unsupported languages
- ‚úÖ `[EMBED] Inside typescript fence at line X` - Shows when position is in fence
- ‚úÖ `[EMBED] spawning lang=X cmd=Y` - Server startup
- ‚úÖ `[EMBED] spawn failed immediately lang=X` - Spawn failures
- ‚úÖ `[EMBED] process error lang=X: <error>` - Runtime errors
- ‚úÖ `[EMBED] forward completion lang=X at line A:B ‚Üí embedded C:D` - Request forwarding with position mapping
- ‚úÖ `[EMBED] forward hover lang=X at line A:B ‚Üí embedded C:D` - Request forwarding with position mapping
- ‚úÖ `[EMBED] completion result lang=X count=N for line Y` - Success confirmation
- ‚úÖ `[EMBED] hover result lang=X available=true for line Y` - Success confirmation
- ‚úÖ `[EMBED] hover unavailable lang=X at line Y` - Failure notification
- ‚úÖ `[EMBED] Fence extraction failed: <error>` - Extraction errors

### Error Messages (console.error)
- ‚úÖ `[server] Parser not initialized` - Critical errors still logged to console

## Before vs After

### Before (Verbose) ‚ùå

```
[LSP-TOY SERVER] onHover called for: file:///.../sample-resume.lsptoy
[LSP-TOY SERVER]   Position: line 22, char 6
[LSP-TOY SERVER]   ‚Üí findFenceAt: docUri=file:///.../sample-resume.lsptoy, position=22:6, cached fences=7
[LSP-TOY SERVER]   ‚Üí Fence ranges:
[LSP-TOY SERVER]      [0] ruby: lines 21-23
[LSP-TOY SERVER]      [1] typescript: lines 34-60
[LSP-TOY SERVER]      [2] python: lines 67-103
[LSP-TOY SERVER]      [3] rust: lines 110-147
[LSP-TOY SERVER]      [4] sql: lines 154-177
[LSP-TOY SERVER]      [5] yaml: lines 184-215
[LSP-TOY SERVER]      [6] bash: lines 222-244
[LSP-TOY SERVER]   ‚Üí Found fence: lang=ruby, lines=21-23
[LSP-TOY SERVER]   ‚Üí Fence check: found=yes (ruby)
[LSP-TOY SERVER]   ‚Üí Position inside embedded fence lang=ruby
[LSP-TOY SERVER] [EMBED] skip lang=ruby: no backend available
[LSP-TOY SERVER]   ‚Üí Embedded hover unavailable, showing helpful hint
[LSP-TOY SERVER]   ‚Üí Using cached parse tree
```

### After (Clean) ‚úÖ

```
[LSP-TOY SERVER]   ‚Üí Inside ruby fence at line 22
[LSP-TOY SERVER] [EMBED] hover unavailable lang=ruby at line 22
```

## Logging Levels

### Always Show (Critical)
- Spawn/initialization events
- Errors and failures
- Position inside fence detection
- Request forwarding with position mapping

### Only on Errors
- Fence extraction failures
- Parser initialization failures

### Never Show (Removed)
- Routine operation confirmations
- Cache hits/misses
- Detailed position information
- Full fence listings
- Return value summaries

## Benefits

### 1. ‚úÖ Less Noise
Logs are 80% shorter, making it easier to spot issues.

### 2. ‚úÖ Still Debuggable
All important events (spawn, errors, forwarding) are logged with line numbers.

### 3. ‚úÖ Faster to Read
Users can quickly see:
- Which fence they're in
- If server is available
- Where requests are forwarded

### 4. ‚úÖ Production Ready
Cleaner logs suitable for end-users, not just developers.

## Testing

After reloading, you should see:

### Document Open
```
[EMBED] ruby fence (unsupported) at line 20
[EMBED] Cached 7 fence(s)
```

### Hover in Ruby Fence
```
‚Üí Inside ruby fence at line 22
[EMBED] hover unavailable lang=ruby at line 22
```

### Hover in TypeScript Fence (Not Installed)
```
‚Üí Inside typescript fence at line 34
[EMBED] spawning lang=typescript cmd=typescript-language-server
[EMBED] spawn failed immediately lang=typescript
[EMBED] hover unavailable lang=typescript at line 34
```

### Hover in TypeScript Fence (Installed & Working)
```
‚Üí Inside typescript fence at line 34
[EMBED] forward hover lang=typescript at line 34:10 ‚Üí embedded 1:10
[EMBED] hover result lang=typescript available=true for line 34
```

Much cleaner! üéØ
